            <h2>TOPIC</h2>
        Group work is a significant part in order for a project or assignment to be successful at any professional and business environment in general and in RMIT university in particular. And in order to have a promising group work, it is essential to have team members share the same goal and vision that the team is leading towards to. Acknowledging this, our team, Group 14, wants to help out students at RMIT university to have the best possible outcome in a project assignment, which our team expect to accomplish by providing the tools to help students find and form a group with the best teammates that meets their expected goals. <br> <br>
The project purpose is not to replace tools that has already somewhat helped the students in the stated problem, but rather as an alternative tool that try to solve it as efficiently as possible. Our team goal is to help students to somewhat solve the original problem, and helping to improve the working experience in at least some degree. <br>

             </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
       As have mentioned above, the motivation of this project is to provide a better tool for RMIT students to form a team with the same expected points of the assignment. One particular aspect of the project that our team think that it is interesting is the fact that it tries to tackle one of many major problems in university life. Although comparing with the current IT trends, it is a bit of an outsider, but it’s purpose is to help a specific group of students, so the group think it only needs to meet the initial goal, without having to have complex system like blockchain or AI.
           </div>
       <div class="container">
            <h2>LANDSCAPE</h2>
           There are already many platforms out there that have been utilized by students to recruit teammates. For example, on Canvas, there is the Discussion section which can be used like fast email, and since Canvas has already been used by all RMIT students already, it is quite good in dealing with the problem. Other platforms like RMIT Vietnam Society on Facebook, or channels on Microsoft teams. Compare this to our project, we think that our tools is more specific on the problem, which we believed may solve it better, rather than being a general-purpose tool.

            <h2>AIMS</h2>
            <div>
    The aim of our project idea is to let students at RMIT form groups for assignments and projects in a fast, efficient and convenient way, removing any unwanted barriers, and helping students with the first step in achieving wanted points for assignment and even in both small and large scale projects in the future. With this aim, we want to change the way groups are formed, and overall improving the working experience during group-assignment. <br><br>
    The first goal is to make the tool as easy to access as possible, which meant that it could be access by any forms of media, like laptops or smartphones. Since the scale of the tool will just focus on the RMIT schools, so I think that it should focus more on the experience of the user, by providing many ways to access it through many platforms. <br><br>
The second goal is to make the communication easier to use. Since I believe that with easier communication, than it will be easier to get to know more about each other. And easier communication here means that it should be fast and cost-free, and one example to demonstrate this goal is the Messenger on Facebook, where you can text any person in a fast and convenient way. <br><br>

The final goal is easy-to-access information. In these days, information is essential to everyone, and so our platforms want to deliver truthful information about each person that’s only related to academic, and these information will be presented on their accounts. By providing more information, we believe that students can know better on whether the people that they are looking for is sharing the same aim for the score or the goal of the project. <br><br>

            <h2>PLANS AND PROGRESS</h2>
            <div>
                The idea was first come up when the team was focused on the project idea of assignment 2. However, this idea was based on the experience of some newbies of RMIT university who might have when they first enter, which is the experience of finding teammates for a group assignment. Though it has been known before that at RMIT, we will have group projects, and though there are some situations where students were randomly assigned to groups, but most of the time it is up to the students to decide on who or which group they will participate in. The process of choosing him or herself a group to us is quite difficult to deal with, since unlike many universities in VietNam, where students were assigned to a class, at RMIT, each student can choose their own courses, which can result in constantly meeting new people. Besides that, newbies also need to get used to working in professional environments, and also try to learn how to communicate well in many situations, which could lead to even more challenges for first-semester students. In order to help cope with this, there has been many tools out there that help to get students to recruit team member of an assignment fast and can start to get to work as soon as possible, like the Discussion forum on Canvas, or Team for Microsoft Teams. However, we find out that these tools can sometimes be slow, and does not provide much information on whether team members are having the same aim for a specific point, or a vision for a project, which could lead to weak cooperation and may reduce the overall scores. Realizing this, our team has proposed a tool that could help students to tackle this problem more efficiently and less time consuming, eventually gave birth to the project idea. However, it was just an idea at that time, and changes will inevitably happen across the development process. <br><br>
1/ Progress so far <br><br>
From ideas though, there are still a lot of things that need to be done before implementing and putting to use in real life. Firstly, after having some initial thoughts, we start to dig deeper on what it needs to be and what it needs to have, like is it going to be a website, or an app, what features it might have, whether it needs to be expanded outside of the school. There are just too much things to consider, so we want to keep it as simple as it could, but still leave rooms for improvement in the future. And after everyone agree all the core features, we start the writing about the idea on paper on assignment 2. This paper is still relatively short, and so more detailed plans and progress are needed. <br><br>
During assignment 3, our team finally have the chance to do more research and include more features and styles to make the project more complete. The website will have a basic design, and will be built in full stack, since it needs to be a dynamic website that constantly updating changes and there will be many features that will be too hard to build from scratch, so we will just use existing tools like Twilio for building the chatting. The front-end will be built in traditional tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript, and the back-end will use relational database or graph database to show the social connection. The website will also may feature a mini game for user to play in free time, but this idea is not official, and may change in the future. If the website is successful enough, we want to build an app version of the website if possible, in order to have connection for users in as many platforms as possible. From the initial idea, by adding more necessary details, we have been able to visualize a more detailed version of the project. <br><br>
However, there are still some problems when we discuss about the project ideas. These problems can range from small to large scale that could cause a fatal flaw when deployed into real life. One of those problems is the tools that we going to use. Though with the front-end, we can use simple tools that have mentioned above, and expand it to a more complex version in the future, but there are still many things that none of the team members have learned yet, since all of us haven’t experienced building a full website from scratch, and we are still first semester students at RMIT. Though we can learn it more in the future, but it will be time consuming and could cause many flaws that none of us have the ability to solve, especially the back-end part in which we have to working with servers and security for storing data. Because of this, we try to choose the tools that can be as simple as possible, like php for back-end, so that we could learn necessary skills as fast as possible with enough knowledge to deal with real life situations. We also come across the fact that the possible users of this tools can impost incorrect information about themselves, which we could have no ways to tell whether the information is correct or not. We have had some small plans to try to deal with this serious drawback, which have resulted in some decisions and changes to the project plan. But for now, we have to accept this situation and we have to do more research if we want to eliminate this. One more major dead end that we might face is the cost of maintenance. Since our website is a dynamic website, we have to constantly update the information online and store the user information, and since we are not planning to make a profit from this project, so we might end up with not having enough money to support it in the future. We really want to be able to control as many things that we could so that we can ensure the quality of our project, but for now, it is nearly impossible for us to deal with these dead-ends without the help of professionals or trying to use the try and errors method. <br><br>
2/ Decisions and changes to the project<br><br>
Beside mentioned problems, many changes have been made to the project plan to ensure that the project plan to be as realistic as possible. One of which is that at first, we plan to make a simple prototype, which would just display basic feature rather than an actual functional prototype. However, due to the problem of using new technologies that have mentioned above, and the project idea at that time was still vague and doesn’t have a clear layout yet, so we decide to postpone the development until week 12, spending the last 4 weeks to actually building the project, after everyone has had the chance to study the needed tools. Another thing that has changed recently is that in the future, if possible, we want to implement to some kind of AI that can help to reduce the workload for maintenance of the website, or make more efficient decision on some situation. But these are all ideas for now. We have also planned to sync the data from the user’s personal account on Canvas to ensure the information that the users post on their personal Homepage is corrected, and also for the purpose of ease of use of the users. However, we are still unsured about this as we might have to have the permission of the RMIT schools to actually incorporate the information of a student to the website. Whether these decisions and changes are good or not may depend on the real-life testing or further research, so that we could have at least some experiences before actually implementing these. <br><br>
3/ Current stage<br><br>
After encountering dead ends, decisions, changes, and ideas, we have been able to work more efficiently on the projects. Right now, we are just at the first stage of the process, which is drafts and plans, rather than starting to work on a real-life product. Since our team thinks that it would be much better for us to have the plans and ideas as clear as possible to avoid many unwanted conflicts in the future. We are still writing on the plan of the project, like what will be our timeline, or what will we do after we see the outcome of the project. We still have to discuss more on the timeframe, the plan in more details, but overall, we still going well with our project. We are planning to finish all the writing by end of week 12, which would also the end for our research on the tools we are planning to use. After that, we will officially start on the working of the real project as soon as possible. Our development time will also need to last longer on than usual. Nevertheless, we believe that these are all just the first step on building the project that we believe can help students at least on the first step in achieving the dream points. If the project turns out successful, we may want to cooperate with the school to improve further the quality of the website, expand it to many medias, and even be used as a tool to help other organization situated in the schools to recruit members for the team, if possible. And with these, we can even use this tool to recruit members for our own team to help work with this project as it started to expand more into the future. These are all pure theoretical now, since in reality, our project can fail at the very first step, which may be quite disappointed to the group, but will be a learning opportunity for every team member to aid them in building their own dream project. In the end, no matter how the ideas will turn out, it will always be meaningful in helping our team to become true IT professional, especially for the fact that all of us are just first year students. <br><br>

            <h2>ROLES</h2>
            <div>
   Our group has four members which are Soohyuk Jang, Bui Minh Khoi, Nguyen Minh Nguyen, Nguyen Duc Quang. Nguyen Duc Quang is a project manager that leads the team by directing members and analyzing the assignment what we should do. This role is important as we are able to recognize which work should we focus on, and what to do next. Nguyen Minh Nguyen is a developer that mainly assembles the member’s work and puts the uploaded work from GitHub into one place. He creates a website that will display assignments by using HTML with outstanding features and make sure whether our team skips certain parts or not. In addition, he managed the face-to-face meeting which can activate the whole group members to involve in the discussion. Soohyuk Jang is a designer that creates a PowerPoint that will be used for explaining the current project ideas. Also, he created a demo screenshot for the project by using Figma to illustrate how the website works and which features are included in the pages. Making a PowerPoint is crucial as we need to deliver our thoughts to the listeners by sharing additional screens that what are we talking about, and what we want to talk about, and of course, building a prototype is important as visualizing is one of the best methods to understand what we are talking about. Bui Minh Khoi was also involved in making a PowerPoint by collecting the whole data and taking part in the group project. This role is important as we need to check because if the work is too long, then the listeners might feel boring and hard to understand, and if works are too short then the listeners might not able to understand what are we talking about when the group performs a PowerPoint about the group project. All the teammates have performed almost equal work which means that none of us had been affected negatively in the project.

            <h2>SCOPES AND LIMITS</h2>
            <div>
                There are some limits in our group project that the developer can’t reach. For example, if the user lives in a place that is far from school, but the place he/she lives might not be on the list in the living place list. Even if the user can’t write down their living place, then it will be hard to find out because there are various ways to describe such as District 7, Quan 7, Phu My Hung that may distract the user to find out the groups or teammates. Also, as I mentioned above, discrimination might occur as some students might want to find people that can speak a certain language which might lose the reason for making a website for students in RMIT. <br> <br>
In addition, even though this website is an advanced version of finding a group or a teammate, checking for notices and reading the notification is up to the user which means that this website will be useless if the user is not willing to check daily and lazy. Furthermore, if not enough students register to this website, then students are not able to use search tools because there are not many groups/people on this website, so advertisement through Facebook group pages or other methods is required to solve this problem.

                (More details are presented in the official team assignment paper)

            <h2>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
            <div>
                For this web project, we are using HTML, CSS and Javascript, but will definitely expanding the tools further due to the nature of our project. Those future tools can be React.js, which is a JavaScript library for making the user interface on the website. Alongside with React, we will also be using Redux, which is also commonly used for programming user interface. For the backend, we decided to use Firebase, which is a hosting service from Google, supporting scalabilities, providing real-time databases, and authentication for our login feature, and will also using php programming language due to its popularity. But first, before making the interface, we would use Adobe Photoshop to create a design for it, specifically the newest version, Adobe Photoshop 21.1.

            <h2>TESTING</h2>
            <div>
I think our projects have some specifics that we need to test on, including compatibility on different devices, scalability, usability of the interface, and security. <br><br>
For the frontend of the website, we will test it by inspecting different elements of the HTML document and compare it to the design in our files. The testing of the frontend could be boosted by using selenium, to scrape the website and automating test cases after scraping the site for HTML elements. <br><br>
In addition, we also need to test our compatibility on different devices by using Chrome developer tools, which shows how our site would look on a wide variety of existing devices. For security, we can hire a security specialist to try and hack our website, but since we’re using Google’s Firebase to operate things on the backend, I really doubt that there is going to be any serious issues. <br><br>
Finally, for the user interface, after making the site live, our team will be collecting user feedback to make sure that they are happy with the interface and their overall experience of our project. <br><br>

We instead focused on the part that we already had a clear idea on and started working on those parts specifically.

            <h2>RISKS</h2>
            <div>
   If the project idea is implemented, there are lots of risks that the developer will face. To maintain the server without any problems, the developer needs to host the server unless RMIT approves to support the finance. As this website is a non-profit website, there is no way to make a profit from operating a website, so the developer might feel financial distress. In addition, there are limits when students use a website such as dishonesty, and notification issues. If the website is not able to sync the data from RMIT canvas, then students can tell a lie about their grades which will cause some conflicts between the website clients. Also, there is a rating system that can evaluate the user based on the experience from teamwork from one to five. This can be a problem as the anonymous user might give the lowest score because he/she doesn't like a certain user even though that person showed the best performance.  Even though the website syncs the data from the RMIT canvas, it will be difficult to get consent from the whole user as some users might feel uncomfortable as a third party is taking their information. If the data storage that contains students’ grades is leaked, then the website will be in big trouble. To prevent this, the server developer needs to deal with the server database. Notification can be an issue even though the chat box enables the user to communicate through the website directly, everything is up to the user that they check notification. If the user is lazy and not willing to check a notification, then the website will be the same as a formal method such as Microsoft teams and Outlook. Furthermore, if the developer wants to develop it with a high quality that involves various functions, impressive design, then the developer needs to learn more in detail about advanced tools and languages such as C++, JavaScript, PHP, React, Angular, or Twilio and many more.

            <h2>PROCESS AND COMMUNICATION</h2>
            <div>
                For the past few weeks working together our team have communicate a lot thought different method both face-to-face and online using Google meet. We change our meeting method depend on our work. If it just a small discussion, then we will have a online meeting to reduce the time we need to go back from home to RMIT because each member of our group live quite far from RMIT. But when we need to practice our talking about big part of the project we tend to work face-to-face because is allow us to have easy communicate and express our thought of the project easier. Thought out of our project every member has participate all the meeting and none is late or absent from the meeting. But if that situation happen, we will try contact the missing person if we can, and if that doesn’t work the we will summary all the necessary information needed to show to the missing person. I expect contact between each member a least twice a week to allow us to know how our team is working and if any changed needed.
